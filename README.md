# 2023 NBA season summary - Warriors VS. Lakers

## Overview

The 2022-2023 NBA season has come to an end and you are a data analyst for The Golden State Warriors. The general manager (GM) has tasked you with creating a data pipeline that extracts end of season data on the whole of the NBA. He also wants to know how the performance of The Golden State Warriors compared to that of there biggest rival team, The Los Angeles Lakers.

## Goal

Create a data pipeline that extracts end of season NBA data, transform this data as you see fit and load the data into a storage facility so the data is readily available for analysis via PowerBI.


## Brief

This project aims to develop a data pipeline which involves data extraction, transformation and loading (ETL), from which we can then apply BI tools to produce metrics/insights from the data. Every year, end of year NBA statistics are uploaded to Kaggle and the GM has suggested that we retrieve the data from there. 

**Good luck!**
